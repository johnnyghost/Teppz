<h4 align="center"> Dark and Light themes for Visual Studio Code</h4>


![Main](https://github.com/ofrades/teppz/raw/master/images/main.png)

**Teppz** is based on the awesome [eppz!](https://github.com/eppz/VSCode.Extension.eppz_Code). For that reason **Teppz** is a new version of a carefully designed theme where colors do have meanings.

This new theme provides a lighter theme, some changes to the dark and one color approach to the IDE.

Languages tested thanks to [Night Owl](https://github.com/sdras/night-owl-vscode-theme) theme [demos](https://github.com/sdras/night-owl-vscode-theme/tree/master/demo).

### Personal Settings:

````
    "editor.fontFamily": "'Cascadia Code', 'Hasklig'",
    "editor.fontLigatures": true,
    "editor.lineHeight": 25,
    "editor.letterSpacing": 0.75,
    "editor.cursorStyle": "line",
    "editor.cursorBlinking": "smooth",
    "editor.cursorWidth": 3,
````

I am also using [Bracket Pair Colorizer](https://github.com/CoenraadS/BracketPair), a really cool extension that highlights matching brackets (works best with the dark theme) and [Material Icon Theme](https://github.com/PKief/vscode-material-icon-theme).

### Future
If you see something wrong or you want some new feature, please feel free to [file an issue](https://github.com/ofrades/Teppz/issues)!

This is my personal theme, so it will be updated everytime I see something that can be improved. Feel free to do the same, asking me to do some changes or doing them yourself.
